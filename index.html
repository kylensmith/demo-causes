					What started as a terrible idea and blossomed into a disaster, George Costanza deserves all the credit for what has been accomplished in the name of people. What began as a fake charity, The Human Fund has done monumental work for people, by people. Today our reach and scope has no bounds as we have affected every human life by encouraging good will and the giving from one human to another.

				<p class="index_paragraph">
					If George could be asked who deserves credit for all the hard work done here at The Human Fund, there is no doubt that he would take credit for most of it (if not all).
